# Automobile_Price_Prediction

- **Description**: This project aims to predict car prices based on various features such as engine type, horsepower, mileage, and other vehicle specifications with high accuracy. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, implementing multiple machine learning models, optimizing hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, and validating models with cross-validation. By comparing the models’ performance using metrics such as R² score, achieving R² score of 0.90 with the best-performing model.
